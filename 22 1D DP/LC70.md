# LC70 - Climbing Stairs

## Solution Description

We are tasked with computing the number of ways one can ascend n stairs, given we can go one or two steps at a time. We denote the number of ways to reach a stair x as `opt[x]`. The key insight in this problem may be stated as follows: we arrive at a stair x from either stair x-1 or stair x-2. This means the number of ways to reach step x, `opt[x]`, is equal to `opt[x-1]` + `opt[x-2]`. If this isn't immediately clear, sketching it out on paper can help visualize the concept. For convenience, we will not use the first array entry (index 0). Having established the recurrence, we need base cases. Our recurrence is two steps deep, requiring two base cases. There is one way to reach the first step, and two ways to reach the second step. Accordingly, we set `opt[1]` to 1 and `opt[2]` to 2.

## Code (Python3)

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 1

        opt = [0 for i in range(n+1)]

        # setting base cases
        opt[1] = 1
        opt[2] = 2

        # computing recursive cases
        for i in range(3,len(opt)):
            opt[i] = opt[i-1] + opt[i-2]

        return opt[n]
```

## Time and Space Complexity

We are using an array of length $n+1$. Then we are iterating through it, with constant time per iteration. Hence, both the time and space complexities are $O(n)$.

## Fun fact

The number of ways to reach the nth stair is the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence!
