# LC141 - Linked List Cycle

In this problem, we are tasked with determining whether a linked list contains a cycle. We discuss two solutions, the first has a linear worst case space complexity, compared to the second solution that has a constant worst case space complexity. Both solutions have the same worst case time complexity.

## Solution 1 - Storing nodes in a Set

### Solution 1 Description

In this solution, we traverse the linked list, while storing the pointers of the nodes we come across in a set. Before inserting a node pointer in the set, we check if it is already in the set. If the node pointer is already in the set, we return true. If we never insert a node pointer that is already in the set, then there is no cycle, so we return false. 

### Solution 1 Code (C++)

```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if (!head)
        {
            return false;
        }
        set<ListNode*> nodePtrs;
        ListNode* llptr = head;
        while (llptr->next)
        {
            if (nodePtrs.count(llptr))
            {
                return true;
            }
            nodePtrs.insert(llptr);
            llptr = llptr->next;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

We are traversing the list through a loop that runs with $n$ iterations, where $n$ is the length of the linked list. Each iteration is constant time. So The total time complexity is $O(n)$.

### Space Complexity

We are storing the $n$ pointers, so the space complexity is $O(n)$.

## Solution 2 - Fast Pointer, Slow Pointer

### Solution 2 Description

In this approach, we use two pointers to iterate throught the linked list; one going twice the speed as the other. So as they start at different values, if at some point, they are the same, then there must be a cycle. Otherwise, there is no cycle. 

### Solution 2 Code (C++)

```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if (!head || !head->next)
        {
            return false;
        }
        ListNode* slowPtr = head;
        ListNode* fastPtr = head->next;
        while (fastPtr->next && fastPtr->next->next)
        {
            if (slowPtr == fastPtr)
            {
                return true;
            }
            slowPtr = slowPtr->next;
            fastPtr = fastPtr->next->next;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
### Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity analysis is similar to the previous approach. The space complexity of this approach is constant, because we aren't storing anything of linear or greater size.
